Experiment 1:
SETUP:
For different grid sizes:
Two positionings of the destination, opposite corner OR random:
MEASURE:
Minimal and maximum and average.

Experiment 2: (Use battery to charge using the shortest path)
SETUP:
For different grid sizes and opposite corner destination:
Add a battery in the center of the grid.
Choose battery as minimum required.
MEASURE:
See how many reached.
SETUP2:
Add the ability to return to the battery using the shortest path.
MEASURE2:
Compare how many reached.

Experiment 3: (Find out at how much battery most robots reach).
SETUP:
For a fixed maze size and opposite corner destination:
Add a battery in the center of the grid.
For battery size between min and max:
MEASURE:
See how many reached.
SETUP2:
Add the ability to return to the battery using the shortest path.
MEASURE2:
Compare how many reached.

Experiment 4 (basic cooperation where robots share map).
SETUP:
Same setup as Experiment 2.
Plus, let robots share the map.
MEASURE:
See how many reached.

Till now, we considered perfect mazes. Now lets look at mazes with loops.

Experiment 5 (show that LHS or RHS get stuck with loop).
Flood fill algorithm as solution.

Experiment 6 (with loops).
SETUP:
Repeat experiment 1 to show and compare floofi with lhs/rhs
MEASURE:
get numbers for min, avg, max.
